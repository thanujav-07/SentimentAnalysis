    "texts = [ \"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\",\n",

    "\"A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. <br /><br />The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only has got all the polari but he has all the voices down pat too. You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets are terribly well done.\",\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable. While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.\",\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Basically there's a family where a little boy thinks there's a zombie in his closet and his parents are fighting all the time. This movie is slower than a soap opera and suddenly the boy decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie. As a drama the movie is watchable, but the thriller elements ruin it.\",\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Petter Mattei's Love in the Time of Money is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look and the acting is good under his direction.\",\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause. Paul Lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes and Bette Davis is a delight. If I had a dozen thumbs, they'd all be up for this movie.\",\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I sure would like to see a resurrection of an updated Seahunt series with the tech they have today. I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt was one of my heroes every week. This would bring back the excitement of underwater adventure.\",\n",
