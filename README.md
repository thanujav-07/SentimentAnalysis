# Sentiment Analysis using NLP & Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **Sentiment Analysis pipeline** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.  
The goal is to classify text reviews as **positive** or **negative** based on their content.

The implementation is done in a **Jupyter Notebook** and focuses on clear, step-by-step understanding of text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification.
